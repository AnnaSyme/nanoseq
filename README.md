## Introduction
The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.


## Documentation
The nf-core/nanodemux pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline, found in the `docs/` directory:

1. [Installation](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)
2. Pipeline configuration
    * [Local installation](https://nf-co.re/usage/local_installation)
    * [Adding your own system config](https://nf-co.re/usage/adding_own_config)
    * [Reference genomes](https://nf-co.re/usage/reference_genomes)
3. [Running the pipeline](docs/usage.md)
4. [Output and how to interpret the results](docs/output.md)
5. [Troubleshooting](https://nf-co.re/usage/troubleshooting)

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add a brief overview of what the pipeline does and how it works -->
## Pipeline Summary
This pipeline 
1. Checking the sample sheet
    * Searches for [Data] tag and finds the column Fastq_path. If this column is empty it will send the run directory to the demultiplexing process and if not it bypasses to the QC step
2. Basecalling and Barcoding (CONDITIONAL)
    * If fastq files are not provided, this process performs demultiplexing by basecalling and barcoding.
    * Must have access to the Nanopore software Guppy and have the kit and barcode kit used on the sample sheet in the format of the example sample sheet provided
3. MinIONQC for quality checking the data
    * [MinIONQC](https://github.com/roblanf/minion_qc) outputs diagnostic plots and data for quality control of sequencing data from Oxford Nanopore's MinION
4. MultiQC
    * [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/docs/) arrange the output produced in the previous step of MinIONQC in a more readable and consolidated format.
