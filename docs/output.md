# nf-core/nanoseq: Output

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). See [`main README.md`](../README.md) for a condensed overview of the steps in the pipeline, and the bioinformatics tools used at each step.

See [Oxford NanoPore website](https://nanoporetech.com/) for more information regarding the sequencing technology, protocol, and for an extensive list of resources.

The directories listed below will be created in the output directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Basecalling and demultiplexing

*Documentation*:  
[Guppy](https://nanoporetech.com/nanopore-sequencing-data-analysis), [qcat](https://github.com/nanoporetech/qcat)

*Description*:  
The pipeline has been written to deal with the various scenarios where you would like to include/exclude the basecalling and demultiplexing steps. This will be dependent on what type of input data you would like to provide the pipeline. Additionally, if you would like to align your samples to a reference genome there are various options for providing this information. Please see [`usage.md`](usage.md#--input) for more details about the format of the input samplesheet, associated commands and how to provide reference genome data.

Guppy will be used to basecall and demultiplex the data. Various options have been provided to customise specific parameters and to be able to run Guppy on GPUs.

If you have a pre-basecalled fastq file then qcat will be used to perform the demultiplexing if you provide the `--skip_basecalling` parameter. If you would like to skip both of these steps entirely then you can provide `--skip_basecalling --skip_demultiplexing` when running the pipeline. As a result, the structure of the output folder will depend on which steps you have chosen to run in the pipeline.

*Output directories*:

* `guppy/fastq/`
  Merged FastQ output files for each barcode.
* `guppy/basecalling/<barcode*>/`  
  FastQ output files for each barcode.
* `guppy/basecalling/unclassified/`  
  FastQ files with reads were unassigned to any given barcode.
* `guppy/basecalling/sequencing_summary.txt`  
  Sequencing summary file generated by Guppy.
* `guppy/basecalling/sequencing_telemetry.js`  
  Sequencing telemetry file generated by Guppy.
* `guppy/basecalling/guppy_basecaller_log-<date>.log`  
  Log file for Guppy execution.
* `qcat/fastq/<barcode*>.fastq.gz`  
  FastQ output files for each barcode.
* `qcat/fastq/none.fastq.gz`  
  FastQ file with reads were unassigned to any given barcode.

## Sequencing QC

*Documentation*:  
[PycoQC](https://github.com/a-slide/pycoQC), [NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot)

*Description*:  
PycoQC and NanoPlot compute metrics and generate QC plots using the sequencing summary information generated by Guppy e.g. distribution of read length, read length over time, number of reads per barcode and other general stats. NanoPlot also generates QC metrics directly from FastQ files.

![PycoQC - Number of Reads per Barcode plot](images/NumberofReadsperBarcode.png)

*Output directories*:

* `pycoQC/`  
  An .html file output is produced that includes a run summary and graphical representation of distribution of read length, distribution of read quality scores, mean read quality per sequence length, output per channel over experiment time, output over experiment time, read quality over experiment time, readlength over experiment time, and percentage of reads per barcode.
* `nanoplot/summary/`  
  An output of .png files of metric plots and an html summary file of overall run.

## FastQ Quality Control

*Documentation*:  
[NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot)

*Description*:  
NanoPlot give general quality metrics about the fastq output per barcode from Guppy. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, read lengths and other general stats.
![Nanoplot - Read quality vs read length](images/NanoPlot_output.png)

*Output directories*:

* `nanoplot/fastq/`
  An output of QC metric plots in individual .png files and in one html file summarizing the output.

## Alignment

*Documentation*:  
[GraphMap2](https://github.com/lbcb-sci/graphmap2), [MiniMap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2), [SortBam](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html)

*Description*:  
The FastQ reads are mapped to the given reference assembly provided using either GraphMap2 or Minimap2 and then sorted and indexed using SAMtools or these processes can be bypassed using the `--skip_alignment` parameter.

The files resulting from the alignment with graphmap2 or minimap2 of individual libraries are not saved by default so this directory will not be present in your results. You can override this behaviour with the use of the `--save_align_intermeds` flag in which case it will contain the coordinate sorted alignment files in [`*.bam`](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) format.

![ALIGNER - Alignment per barcode](images/mqc_samtools_alignment_plot_1.png)

*Output directories*:

* `graphmap2/`
  If the `--aligner graphmap2` parameter is used, the sorted and indexed bam files will be output here.
* `minimap2/`
  If the `--aligner minimap2` parameter is used, the sorted and indexed bam files will be output here.
* `<ALIGNER>/samtools_stats/`
  `*.flagstat`, `*.idxstats` and `*.stats` files generated from the alignment files using SAMtools.

## bigWig and bigBed

*Documentation*:
[`BEDTools`](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/), [`bedGraphToBigWig`](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/), [`bedToBigBed`](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/)

*Description*:
Creation of bigWig and bigBed coverage tracks for visualisation. This can be bypassed by setting the parameters `--skip_bigwig` and/or `--skip_bigbed`.

*Output directories*:

* `<ALIGNER>/bigwig/`  
  The bigWig files will be output here.
* `<ALIGNER>/bigbed/`  
  The bigbed files will be output here.

## MultiQC

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualisation tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in within the report data directory.

The pipeline has special steps which allow the software versions used to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability.

*Output directories*:

* `multiqc/Project_multiqc_report.html`  
  MultiQC report - a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser
* `multiqc/multiqc_data/`  
  Directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline
* `multiqc/multiqc_plots/`
  Directory containing the image files of the graphs included in MultiQC

For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see [http://multiqc.info](http://multiqc.info)

## Pipeline information

*Documentation*:  
[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html)

Nextflow provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to trouble-shoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.

*Output directories*:

* `pipeline_info/`  
  * Reports generated by the pipeline - `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.csv`.
  * Reports generated by Nextflow - `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.svg`.
  * Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline - `samplesheet_reformat.csv`.
